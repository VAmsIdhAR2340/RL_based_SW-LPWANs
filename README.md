The widespread use of the Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates large-scale communication among smart IoT devices (IoDs) across a wide geographical area. 
However, due to the limited radio range and scalability issues of traditional wireless sensor networks, wide-area communication among IoDs is not feasible. 
As a solution, a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) is emerging as one of the techniques that can provide long-range communication with minimal power consumption. 
Nevertheless, the direct data transmission approach will no longer be viable due to its short network lifetime. As such, multihop data routing strategies for LPWANs 
are proposed in the literature. However, multihop data transmission has several challenges, including increased data latency, energy imbalance, poor bandwidth utilization, 
and low data throughput. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that uses the machine learning technique for an energy-efficient and 
Quality-of-Service (QoS)-aware data transfer based on a recent breakthrough in social networks known as small-world characteristics (SWC).
